# batch3dfier

This package is a wrapper around the [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier) software and helps you 3dfy datasets in batch. The idea for the package came from the need to efficiently create a 3D model for the whole Netherlands, using building footprints from the [BAG](https://www.kadaster.nl/basisregistratie-gebouwen) dataset and the [AHN](http://www.ahn.nl/) pointcloud.

Therefore currently some database related parameters (e.g. field names) are hard-coded for a BAG database that has been created from PostgreSQL dump found at [http://data.nlextract.nl/bag/postgis/](http://data.nlextract.nl/bag/postgis/).

## Setting up a BAG database

As noted above, I used the PostgreSQL dump provided at [http://data.nlextract.nl/bag/postgis/](http://data.nlextract.nl/bag/postgis/). The dump was restored with the command

`pg_restore --no-owner --no-privileges -d bag bag-laatst.backup`

The additional and required settings are described in `prep_bag_tiles.sql`.

## How to run it

`python3 batch3dfy.py -c batch3dfier_config.yml`

Where `batch3dfier_config.yml` is the YAML configuration file that *batch3dfier* uses (similarly to *3dfier*).

In the YAML file there are two options to tell batch3dfier what to extrude:

1. provide a polygon for the area

    ```
    input_polygons:
        extent: path/to/polygon
    ```
2. give a list of 2D tile IDs

    ```
    input_polygons:
        tile_list: 25gn1, 25ez1
    ```

Not all of the *3dfier* configuration options are mirrored in the *batch3dfier* configuration file. If you notice that something is missing that you need, add it manually in the source of `config.yamlr()`.


## A few design details

2D polygons are stored in PostgreSQL, pointcloud in files.

A spatial dataset that covers a whole country can be rather large to 3dfy in one go, the BAG is no exception. Therefore it is partitioned into rectangular tiles, where a tile is stored as a PostgreSQL *view* of the polygons within the partition. Physically, a partition is a polygon and a corresponding ID, stored in second dataset which is referred to as the *tile index*.

The *view* names composed as *t_\<tile ID\>*.

Currently, *batch3dfier* matches the 2D tiles to the pointcloud tiles on their ID. This is because the [AHN tile index](http://www.ahn.nl/binaries/content/assets/ahn-nl/downloads/ahn_subunits.zip) was used to partition the 2D dataset.

*batch3dfier* tries to find the matching poincloud file for the 2D tile in the provided directory (`dataset_dir:`) and it skips the tile if it cannot find the file.

The diagram below tries to illustrate how the tile, view, file and variable names relate to each other. Variable names are always the last, e.g. `tile_views` or `pc_tile`.

                     +-------------+
                     | AHN tile ID |
                     |      =      |
          +----------+   tile ID   +--------+
          |          |   (25gn1)   |        |
          |          |      =      |        |
          |          |    tiles    |        |
          |          +-------------+        |
          |                                 |
+---------v---------+               +-------v-------+
|    2D tile name   |               | AHN file name |
|          =        |               | (C_25GN1.LAZ) |
| 2D tile View name |               |       =       |
|      (t_25gn1)    |               |    pc_tile    |
|          =        |               |               |
|      tile_views   |               +---------------+
|                   |
+---------+---------+
          |
          |
  +-------v--------+
  |output file name|
  |       =        |
  |    tile_out    |
  |                |
  +----------------+
```

In order to process several tiles efficiently *batch3dfier* starts 3 concurrent threads, each of them processing a single tile at a time.
